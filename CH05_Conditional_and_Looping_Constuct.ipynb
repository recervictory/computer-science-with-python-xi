        "In the previous chapters, we have learnt the basics of Python programming where we were dealing with simple short programs containing a sequence of instructions given for carrying out a particular task. They were all in a sequence, i.e., one after the other. In real life also, this sequence of operations is observed when a school bus carries schoolchildren from school to home and vice versa as shown in Fig. 5.1.\n",

        " The Arithmetic Logic Unit involves all mathematical operations and conversions. We will now focus on Logic Unit which makes a computer think; so we need to write the code. In real-life scenarios also, we often go with the flow and tend to take decisions, such as after completing the 10th standard, we decide which stream to go for and after. completing graduation, one has to decide which company to join. Similarly, if you have ever used Google Maps direction services to reach from one place to : another, you might have noticed that sometimes it shows more than one path: the least crowded path, shortest distance path, etc. and you can decide which path to take as per your priorities. A decision may involve choosing one of the two or more possible options.\n",

        "Similarly, In Python also, we have a keyword 'if' which helps in taking decisions. In the above figure, we have used a tool for depicting this decision-making which is the flow chart. Therefore, before discussing conditional constructs offered by Python, we will learn about the most extensively-used logic development tool, which is a flow chart, that helps in better understanding the problem statement and decisions to be made accordingly. These are also sometimes termed as programming skill development techniques."

Statements constitute the smallest executable unit within a Python program. Python statements are classified into three types:\n",

        "- Simple Statement (Single Statement)\n",

        "---\n",
        "- **Empty Statement**: It is the simplest statement or, more precisely, we can say it is an empty statement which serves as a placeholder in Python. pass is a special (empty) statement in Python that does nothing. It only works as a dummy statement. Its syntax is:\n",
        "    > pass\n",
        "\n",
        "    It can be used when a statement is required syntactically but the program requires no action to be performed. Since Python does not support empty code blocks, we can use pass statement for the no-operation in the if-condition block, if-else block and even in while loop.\n",
        "- **Simple Statement**: A simple statement in Python comprises a single logical statement. For example, consider the following single statement:\n",
        "    > name=input (\"Enter your Name:\")\n",
        "    > print (name)\n",
        "\n",

        "    > x = 10\n",
        "    \n",
        "    which means that we are assigning a value `10`to the variable `x`. This we call a simple statement. The computation statements (expression statements) are also called simple statements. These statements will compute or calculate some expressions and return the results.\n",

        "    > x = (10 + 15)\n",
        "    \n",
        "    is an expression statement.Thus, a simple statement is described as a single executable statement in Python.\n",
        "- **Compound Statement**: A compound statement is a statement which comprises a group of statements. The compound statements usually execute when a condition is satisfied, or a code block is called directly or through a function call.\n",
